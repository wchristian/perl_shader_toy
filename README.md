# Perl Shader Toy

This repository contains a small toy that might eventually become a perl demo and will otherwise serve as a testing ground for modern OpenGL features in Perl.

At the moment it requires [this branch](https://github.com/wchristian/OpenGL.pm/tree/gltut) of OpenGL.pm, as well as the framework in this [repository of OpenGL tutorials](https://github.com/wchristian/gltut).
